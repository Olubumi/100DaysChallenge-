#100DaysChallenge for Techies
I created this repo to share tips, resources and doses of motivation to help you start and finish the 100 Days Learning Challenge, whether you want to learn software engineering, UI/UX design, data science, data engineering, open source, etc.

Join the Slack community for this Challenge to meet like-minded people and collaborate on projects.
